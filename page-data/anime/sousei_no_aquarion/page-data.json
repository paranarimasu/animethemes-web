Mystical creatures who returned after 12.000 years of absence. They attack human cities and kidnap their inhabitants in order to drain their \"prana\" (vital energy). To fight against them, youngsters with special powers from around the world were gathered and trained to pilot the \"vector machines\", three ancient ships that together form mankind's ultimate weapon, \"Aquarion\". <br>\n<br>\nThe story revolves mainly around Apollo, a teenager rumored as the reincarnation of Apolonius, a fallen angel who fought against his own kind to protect mankind. Few believe it could be true, but the fact is that despite his untamed and reckless nature, he proved to be an invaluable asset in the battle against the Shadow Angels.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network, edited)","synonyms":["Aquarion","Genesis of Aquarion","Holy Genesis Aquarion"],"series":[{"slug":"aquarion","name":"Aquarion"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Sousei no Aquarion","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"bless4","name":"bless4"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"sousei_no_aquarion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"3-17, 26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SouseiNoAquarion-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Go Tight","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"sousei_no_aquarion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"18-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SouseiNoAquarion-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Omna Magni","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yui_makino","name":"Yui Makino"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"sousei_no_aquarion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-13, 15, 17, 19-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SouseiNoAquarion-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"16","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"SouseiNoAquarion-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/478/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/478/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/sousei-no-aquarion","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/2830","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5261"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5262"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sousei_no_aquarion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
