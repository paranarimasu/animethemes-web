The main character that has a romantic feeling for her secretly follows her around and looks for the opportunities to run into her in a manner that seems like a coincidence. Unfortunately for him, she is not interested in love yet, so she does not notice his feelings. What awaits these two characters are a series of crazy incidents caused by bizarre individuals, such as a person who introduces himself as Tengu, the god of second-hand books, or a money lender, who collects young men's underwear and lives on a three story barge.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Sugoi Japan, edited)","synonyms":["Night Is Short, Walk on Girl"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Kouya wo Aruke","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"akfg","name":"Asian Kung-Fu Generation"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"yoru_wa_mijikashi_arukeyo_otome"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"YoruWaMijikashiArukeYoOtome-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34537/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/97917/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/yoru-wa-mijikashi-arukeyo-otome","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/12647","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6131"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6132"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"yoru_wa_mijikashi_arukeyo_otome"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
