One night Amu makes a wish that she would have the courage to be reborn as her \"would-be\" self. The next morning Amu finds three brightly colored eggs&mdash;red, blue, and green&mdash;in her bed. Each egg eventually hatches into a Guardian Character: Ran, Miki, and Su. Guardian Characters are angel-like beings that aid a person into becoming their \"would-be\" selves and fulfill the person's dreams. The Guardian Characters accomplish this by giving encouragement and advice, but they can also temporarily change a person's personality and abilities. With the Guardian Characters, Amu's life becomes much more complex as she now struggles to deal with her new personalities and the Seiyo Elementary Guardians&mdash;a student council group where each member has their own Guardian Character&mdash;who recruits Amu to search for and seal the X eggs and X Characters, corrupted forms of people's dreams.","synonyms":["Guardian Character!"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Kokoro no Tamago","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"shugo_chara"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShugoChara-OP1-Lyrics","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"ShugoChara-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Minna Daisuki","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"shugo_chara"},"entries":[{"episodes":"27-51","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShugoChara-OP2-Lyrics","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"ShugoChara-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Honto no Jibun","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"shugo_chara"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShugoChara-ED1","lyrics":true,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":400,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Renai â™¥ Rider","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"shugo_chara"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShugoChara-ED2","lyrics":true,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":400,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Kiss!
