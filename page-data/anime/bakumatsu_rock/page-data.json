The Tokugawa shogunate uses the brainwashing Heaven's Songs by the top idols in Shinsengumi to subjugate the country and its people. In this Japan, writing or singing any songs besides the Heaven's Songs is a capital offense. Sakamoto Ryouma and the other rockers rise up and change the world with rock 'n' roll for freedom and justice.\r\n\r\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["Samurai Jam -Bakumatsu Rock-"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Jack","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"vistlip","name":"vistlip"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"bakumatsu_rock"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BakumatsuRock-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Zecchou DAYBREAK","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"bakumatsu_rock"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BakumatsuRock-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"BakumatsuRock-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23037/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/20649/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/441"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/442"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bakumatsu_rock"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
