However, thanks to super-science, the Earth itself was saved and today no one really thinks much about that century-past disaster. Which is why when teenage Haruka Amami auditions for something called the Idolmaster Project, she THINKS she's trying out to be a singing idol. Instead, Haruka finds herself at a secret school run by the Mondenkind Agency, living with a group of other girls who have also been selected as candidates to pilot an iDOL - an advanced robot specifically designed to intercept falling chunks of moon rock. Except, the people who run the Mondenkind Agency aren't exactly knights in shining armor. And then there's the question of whether the iDOLs are really JUST robots. Because from almost the first moment, Haruka starts to feel emotions resonating from within the iDOL called Imber. <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":["Idolmaster Xenoglossia"],"series":[{"slug":"idolmaster","name":"The iDOLM@STER"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Binetsu S.O.S!!","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"miyuki_hashimoto","name":"Miyuki Hashimoto"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"idolm_at_ster_xenoglossia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"3-8","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"9-15","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP1v3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Zankoku yo Kibou to Nare","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aira_yuuki","name":"Aira Yuuki"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"idolm_at_ster_xenoglossia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"16-19","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"20-24","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP2v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"25","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP2v3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":4,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-OP2v4","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"Over","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Yuukyuu no Tabibito~Dear Boy","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"idolm_at_ster_xenoglossia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-22, 24-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"IdolmasterXenoglossia-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1694/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1694/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/idolm-ster-xenoglossia","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/4773","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2377"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2378"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"idolm_at_ster_xenoglossia"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
