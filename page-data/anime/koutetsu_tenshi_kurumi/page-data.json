While the Imperial Army wanted to use the Steel Angel as a new means of modern warfare, Ayanokoji wanted his creation to be a new step in the future of mankind. Thus, he defied orders from the Army and secretly made the Steel Angel codenamed \"Kurumi\". Then one day, a young boy named Nakahito Kagura snuck into Ayanokoji's house as a dare by his friends and stumbled upon Kurumi's lifeless body. A sudden attack by the Imperial Army shook the house, causing Kurumi to fall on Nakahito. At that moment, their lips met, and Kurumi woke up from \"the kiss that started a miracle\". <br><br>\r\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["Steel Angel Kurumi"],"series":[{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi","name":"Koutetsu Tenshi Kurumi"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Kiss Kara Hajimaru Miracle","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoutetsuTenshiKurumi-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Eien no Koutetsu Tenshi","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoutetsuTenshiKurumi-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/554/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/554/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3075"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3076"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"koutetsu_tenshi_kurumi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
