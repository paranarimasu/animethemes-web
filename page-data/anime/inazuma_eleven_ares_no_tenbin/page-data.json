Taking place sometime after Raimon's victory in the Football Frontier, in this alternative universe, the alien attack from the second season never occurs. Japanese soccer has been deemed weak compared to international competition. Due to this, the Raimon Eleven have been disbanded, and its members are sent to different soccer teams across Japan in the hopes of strengthening Japan's soccer at a national level. Moreover, in the modern world of Japanese youth soccer, sponsorship has become a vital aspect of a team's survival. A youth team must have a sponsor, otherwise, their club will face disbandment, and are not permitted to partake in matches.<br><br>\n\nThe series focuses on the forward Asuto Inamori and his team, Inakuni Raimon, which is made up of players from the remote Inakunijima Island. They have replaced the original Raimon Eleven as Raimon Junior High's soccer team, and are competing as underdogs in the annual Football Frontier youth tournament.<br><br>\n\n(Source: Wikpedia)","synonyms":[],"series":[{"slug":"inazuma_eleven","name":"Inazuma Eleven"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Teppen e Dasshu!","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"inazuma_eleven_ares_no_tenbin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"InazumaElevenAresNoTenbin-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Koisuru Otome wa Amamoyou","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"inazuma_eleven_ares_no_tenbin"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"InazumaElevenAresNoTenbin-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33733/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21879/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/inazuma-eleven-ares-no-tenbin","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2413"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2414"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"inazuma_eleven_ares_no_tenbin"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
