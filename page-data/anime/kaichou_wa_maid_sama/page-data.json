With the female population still a minority and living in fear of the over-the-top antics of the males, Misaki Ayuzawa takes it into her own hands to reform the school and allow the girls to feel safe in the rough environment.<br><br>\nTraining, studying and even becoming the first female student council president of the school, Misaki has gained a reputation among the male students body as an uptight boy-hating dictator and as a shining hope for the teachers and fellow female students. However, despite her tough-as-nails appearance, she secretly works part-time at a maid cafe in order to support her family. Unfortunately, her hard-earned reputation is threatened when the popular, attractive, and somewhat impassive Usui Takumi takes an interest in her after discovering her in a maid uniform after school.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)","synonyms":["Maid-Sama!","Kaicho wa Maidsama","Kaichou wa Meido Sama","Class President is a Maid!"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"My Secret","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kaichou_wa_maid_sama"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KaichouWaMaidSama-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Yokan","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kaichou_wa_maid_sama"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-15","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KaichouWaMaidSama-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"âˆž Loop","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kaichou_wa_maid_sama"},"entries":[{"episodes":"16-26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KaichouWaMaidSama-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7054/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/7054/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kaichou-wa-maid-sama","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2655"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2656"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kaichou_wa_maid_sama"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
