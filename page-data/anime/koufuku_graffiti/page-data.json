To keep herself occupied in that big empty space, Ryou practices her cooking, something that she thought she excelled at… but nothing ever seems quite right anymore. There’s something missing, but what could it be?<br>\n<br>\nThe answer unexpectedly arrives with her runaway cousin Kirin, who’s looking for a place to stay while she attends cram school. Much to Ryou’s surprise, her cooking seems to improve when they eat together! Food, it turns out, always seems tastier when it’s made for and shared with people you care about, and things only get more appetizing when Ryou’s friend Shiina joins in the culinary adventures!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":["Gourmet Girl Graffiti","Happy Cooking Graffiti"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Shiawase ni Tsuite Watashi ga Shitteiru Itsutsu no Houhou","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"maaya_sakamoto","name":"Maaya Sakamoto"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"koufuku_graffiti"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoufukuGraffiti-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"KoufukuGraffiti-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Egao ni Naru","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"asuka_oogame","name":"Asuka Oogame"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"koufuku_graffiti"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KoufukuGraffiti-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/24629/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/20744/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/koufuku-graffiti","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/10684","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3067"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3068"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"koufuku_graffiti"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
