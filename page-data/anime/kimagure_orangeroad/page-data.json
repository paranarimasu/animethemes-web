Kyosuke also must try to avoid breaking the heart of the slightly childish Hikaru Hiyama, who fell in love with him after she saw him make an impossible shot with a basketball and who likes to shower him with affection. Also, just to make things interesting, Kyosuke, his sisters, his grandfather, and his cousins all have various powers (teleportation, psychokinesis, hypnosis, time travel, personality transference) which Kyosuke desperately tries to keep a secret, though some of the other family members have no such qualms against using their powers in public.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["Kimagure Orange Road TV","Capricious Orange Road"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Night of summer side","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-19","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Orange Mystery","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"20-36","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP3","song":{"title":"Kagami no naka no actress","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"37-48","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-OP3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Natsu no mirage","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-19","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Sad Heart Burning","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"20-36","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Dance in Memories","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"},"entries":[{"episodes":"37-48","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"KimagureOrangeRoad-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1087/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1087/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/kimagure-orange-road","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/153","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2871"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2872"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kimagure_orangeroad"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
