Beings called the Goddesses rule the countries of this unreal world. The four Goddesses govern four states: Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox.

It was the dawn of a new, dynamic era marked occasionally by shared laughter, disputes as well cooperation.<br><br>\r\nWhat does the future hold in store for Gamindustri?<br><br>\r\n(Source: Official Site)","synonyms":["Kami Jigen Game Neptune V","Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Dimension tripper!!!!","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"choujigen_game_neptune_the_animation"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-OP1","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-OP1v2","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Neptune☆Sagashite","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"junjou_no_afilia","name":"Junjou no Afilia"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"choujigen_game_neptune_the_animation"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-2, 5-7, 12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-ED1","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"8-9, 11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-ED1v2","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Go→Love & Peace","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ayane","name":"Ayane"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"choujigen_game_neptune_the_animation"},"entries":[{"episodes":"3-4","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-ED2","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Ito","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"junjou_no_afilia","name":"Junjou no Afilia"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"choujigen_game_neptune_the_animation"},"entries":[{"episodes":"10","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-ED3-Lyrics","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"ChoujigenGameNeptune-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/16157/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/16157/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/choujigen-game-neptune-the-animation","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/863"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/864"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"choujigen_game_neptune_the_animation"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
