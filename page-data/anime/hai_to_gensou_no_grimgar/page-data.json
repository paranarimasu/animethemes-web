Thrown into a foreign land with nothing but hazy memories and the knowledge of their name, they can feel only these three emotions resonating deep within their souls. A group of strangers is given no other choice than to accept the only paying job in this game-like world—the role of a soldier in the Reserve Army—and eliminate anything that threatens the peace in their new world, Grimgar.<br><br>\n\nWhen all of the stronger candidates join together, those left behind must create a party together to survive: Manato, a charismatic leader and priest; Haruhiro, a nervous thief; Yume, a cheerful hunter; Shihoru, a shy mage; Mogzo, a kind warrior; and Ranta, a rowdy dark knight. Despite its resemblance to one, this is no game—there are no redos or respawns; it is kill or be killed.<br><br>\n\nIt is now up to this ragtag group of unlikely fighters to survive together in a world where life and death are separated only by a fine line.<br><br>\n\n(Source: MyAnimeList)","synonyms":["Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash","Grimgal of Ashes and Illusion","Grimgal of Ashes and Fantasies","Hai to Gensou no Grimgal"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Knew day","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"know_name","name":"(K)NoW_NAME"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-5","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Grimgar-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Grimgar-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"6-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"Grimgar-OP1v2-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Grimgar-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Harvest","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"know_name","name":"(K)NoW_NAME"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-6","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Grimgar-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"7, 9-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"Grimgar-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31859/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21428/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/hai-to-gensou-no-grimgar","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1975"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1976"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"hai_to_gensou_no_grimgar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
