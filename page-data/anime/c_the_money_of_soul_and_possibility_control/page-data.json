For its citizens, however, life has not improved and unemployment, crime, suicide, and despair are rampant. Kimimaro, raised by his maternal aunt after the disappearance of his father and the death of his mother, is a scholarship student whose only dream is to live a stable, ordinary life. One day he meets a man who offers him a large sum of money if he will allow his \"future\" to be held as collateral. From then on his fate is radically altered as he's drawn into a mysterious realm known as the Financial District, where he must compete in weekly tournaments called \"deals\" in order to keep his money and avoid losing his future.\r\n(Source: Wikipedia) ","synonyms":["[C] - CONTROL - The Money and Soul of Possibility"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Matryoshka","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"nico_touches_the_walls","name":"NICO Touches the Walls"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"c_the_money_of_soul_and_possibility_control"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Control-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"RPG","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"school_food_punishment","name":"School Food Punishment"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"c_the_money_of_soul_and_possibility_control"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Control-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10163/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/10163/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/c-the-money-of-soul-and-possibility-control","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/8149","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/753"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/754"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c_the_money_of_soul_and_possibility_control"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
