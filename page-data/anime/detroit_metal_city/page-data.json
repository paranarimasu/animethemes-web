There's just one catch. That \"hottest ticket\" is just a meal ticket, and beneath the makeup, these ultimate head-bangers are hired doppelgangers who don't even LIKE what they do! Jaggi is actually Wada, who wants to play glam rock; Camus is Nishida, an anime fan with an appalling weakness for curry and NSFW videos; and Krauser is... oh the shame... street-singing Soichi Negishi, whose dreams of singing happy pop hits seem hopelessly doomed by the success of his rage-fueled alter ego! Worse, he can't even tell anyone who Krauser is. Not even the girl he likes, who HATES DMC! Will rage against the corporate machine consume Negishi's tortured soul? Is there life after death metal? What it's like to put your head in a jet engine and turn up the volume? <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":["Detroit Metal City: The Animated Series","DMC"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Satsugai","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"detroit_metal_city"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DetroitMetalCity-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Amai Koibito","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"detroit_metal_city"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DetroitMetalCity-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/3702/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/3702/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1131"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1132"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"detroit_metal_city"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
