Unfortunately, when Harumi gets himself killed, he inexplicably finds himself reincarnated as a dogâ€¦ which might not be so bad if he could read, or his new owner didn't have the unfortunate twin predilections of playing with scissors and tormenting her new pet! But what truly makes this strange reincarnation the worst of all possible worlds is that she's also his FAVORITE AUTHOR! The horror! Can Harumi find a way to live with this tantrum throwing typist, or will her crazed clippings prove to be his undoing? Can he escape her constant hounding via the doggy door, or is he barking up the wrong tree? There's a rough, rough time ahead as canine compulsive readers and literary she-wolves get snippy with each other when doggies do what they gotta do!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":["Dog & Scissors","InuHasa","Dog and Scissors"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Wan Wan Wan Wan N_1!!","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ai_kakuma","name":"Ai Kakuma"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"kana_asumi","name":"Kana Asumi"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"marina_inoue","name":"Marina Inoue"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"shizuka_itou","name":"Shizuka Itou"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"yuu_serizawa","name":"Yuu Serizawa"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"inu_to_hasami_wa_tsukaiyou"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"InuToHasamiWaTsukaiyou-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Lemonade Scandal","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yuu_serizawa","name":"Yuu Serizawa"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"inu_to_hasami_wa_tsukaiyou"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"InuToHasamiWaTsukaiyou-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/17831/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/17831/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/inu-to-hasami-wa-tsukaiyou","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/9663","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2443"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/2444"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"inu_to_hasami_wa_tsukaiyou"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
