Despite his independence, however, he's yet to mature emotionally, and his problems continue to haunt him in his daily life. His relationship with his adoptive family is strained, and he has difficulties interacting with his fellow high school students.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, his professional career in Shogi has entered a slump. Burdened with the heavy expectations placed upon him, his wins and losses are fluctuating as his record and progression into the ranks begin to stagnate.<br>\n<br>\nAcquainted with Rei are the three Kawamoto sisters: Akari, Hinata, and Momo. Unlike Rei, they live happily in their modest home, which they warmly welcome Rei into as if he were one of their own.  He frequently visits the family, interacting with them and receiving the kind of care and affection he never quite had while under his foster home.<br>\nThis is the story of Rei's triumphs and failures, relationships new and old, and his growth as a person.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: TV Tropes)","synonyms":["March Comes in Like a Lion","Sangatsu no Lion"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Answer","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"bump_of_chicken","name":"BUMP OF CHICKEN"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SangatsuNoLion-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Sayonara Bystander","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yuki","name":"YUKI"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"12-22","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SangatsuNoLion-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Fighter","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"bump_of_chicken","name":"BUMP OF CHICKEN"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-6, 8-11, 22","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SangatsuNoLion-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Nyaa Shougi Ondo","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ai_kayano","name":"Ai Kayano"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"kana_hanazawa","name":"Kana Hanazawa"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"misaki_kuno","name":"Misaki Kuno"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"7","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SangatsuNoLion-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"orion","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"},"entries":[{"episodes":"12-21","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SangatsuNoLion-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31646/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21366/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/29"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/30"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3_gatsu_no_lion"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
