Cromartie Koukou","year":2003,"season":"Fall","synopsis":"Folks, meet Takashi Kamiyama. Enrolled at Cromartie High, where everybody is a delinquent, Kamiyama is apparently the only non-delinquent in the school. Logically, therefore, he must be the toughest in his class - by the rather twisted logic that only a really tough rabbit would lie down with lions.

Oh, and Freddie Mercury is in it, too.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["Cromartie High School"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Jun","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"sakigake_cromartie_koukou"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SakigakeCromartieKoukou-OP1-NCBD","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"SakigakeCromartieKoukou-OP1","lyrics":true,"nc":false,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Trust Me","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"sakigake_cromartie_koukou"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SakigakeCromartieKoukou-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/114/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/114/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4739"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4740"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sakigake_cromartie_koukou"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
