Whatever is lost or stolen, they can definitely get it back. Despite their powerful abilities and enthusiastic behavior, Ban and Ginji are terminally broke no matter what they do simply because little people would actually desire to hire them. As a result, the pair of them tend to do dangerous jobs, often leading to unwanted re-encounters with their old (and dangerous) friends.","synonyms":["GetBackers: Dakkan'ya"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Yuragu Koto Nai Ai","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-25, 49","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Barairo no Sekai","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"26-28","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"29-49","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-OP2v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Ichibyo No Refrain","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Namida no Hurricane","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Mr. Déjà vu","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"26-37","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED4","song":{"title":"Changin'","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"getbackers"},"entries":[{"episodes":"38-48","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GetBackers-ED4","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/132/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/132/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1687"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1688"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"getbackers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
