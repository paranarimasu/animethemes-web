However, it seems this is false as wolves have not disappeared but rather have taken human form. Kiba, a lone wolf, wanders into a city, trying to sniff out the Lunar Flowers that are supposed to lead whoever follows the scent to paradise. The source of the smell is Cheza, a girl who sleeps in what appears to be suspended animation in a lab. She and the wolves are drawn to each other, and Kiba hopes to find paradise once he finds the source of the scent of Lunar Flowers. However, once Kiba finds Cheza, she is kidnapped by a mysterious person called Darcia, and his search begins anew. Before he leaves the city, he meets 3 other wolves, Tsume, Hige and Toboe. All four wolves have very different personalities and ideas, and their friendliness towards each other is a little rough around the edges. However, they soon band together to continue to search for paradise. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["Wolf Rain","Wolfs Rain"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Stray","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"wolfs_rain"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"WolfsRain-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Gravity","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"maaya_sakamoto","name":"Maaya Sakamoto"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"wolfs_rain"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"WolfsRain-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Tell Me What the Rain Knows","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"maaya_sakamoto","name":"Maaya Sakamoto"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"wolfs_rain"},"entries":[{"episodes":"26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"WolfsRain-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Over","resolution":576,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/202/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/202/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/wolf-s-rain","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6013"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6014"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"wolfs_rain"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
