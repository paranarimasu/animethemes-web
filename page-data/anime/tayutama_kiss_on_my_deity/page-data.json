He goes to school, works on people's motorcycles and performs exorcisms.  Okay, that last part's a little bit unusual, but his family lives in a shrine and they do that sort of thing.  Still, you would think he'd know enough to be careful with an ancient relic he finds in the woods, especially when a mysterious goddess appears and tells him to leave it alone.  Unfortunately, despite Mito's best efforts, the seal gets broken anyway and a number of dangerous \"tayuti\" that it held in stasis get loose.  This is bad.  Mito also ends up with a beautiful goddess girl who decides that she's going to marry him.  This might not be so bad. if he wasn't already caught up in the middle of a war between the entities he's released.  The flesh may be weak but the spirit's more than willing to compensate. <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":["Tayutama ~ Kiss on My Deity"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"The fine every day","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tayutama_kiss_on_my_deity"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Tayutama-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Kizuna no Uta","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tayutama_kiss_on_my_deity"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Tayutama-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/5734/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/5734/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tayutama-kiss-on-my-deity","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5507"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5508"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tayutama_kiss_on_my_deity"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
