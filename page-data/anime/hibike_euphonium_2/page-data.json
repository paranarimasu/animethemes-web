Euphonium 2","year":2016,"season":"Fall","synopsis":"With another tournament fast approaching, Kumiko's band is doubling down on practice and discipline, leaving little time for sleep or other recreational activities. The redoubled practice schedule brings Kumiko and Reina closer together, but elsewhere in the band, it seems like drama threatens to tear the group's unity apart.
