One day Eiji finds a mysterious book called the \"Pikachin Research Book,\" and learns about the seven tools that make up the Pikachin Kit. Eiji presses a button inside the research book, and immediately a \"Future Amazon\" delivery arrives at his door with the kit. Eiji uses the blueprints included in the box to assemble the kit, but it seems as though 1% part of the kit is still missing. <br><br>\n\nIn the franchise, the word \"Pikachin\" means the flash of inspiration or insight one gets about a new project, similar to the visual of a lightbulb turning on above one's head when someone has an idea. The concept of the franchise is \"invention is 99% plastic models, 1% inspiration.\"<br><br>\n\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["Pochitto Hatsumei: Pikachin-Kit"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Poka☆Chin Time","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-65","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"bring back","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"66-115","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Poka☆Chin Time","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13, 66-115","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Dracaena","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-65","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PikachinKit-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/36552/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/100910/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/n7mj1ESzN22p1d2BM550eft6HiMUE4xT2kqvpNS8.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/YyViLGMyJV17RyD9PsyWBBURwsIBBBerqosnDZ20.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pikachin_kit"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
