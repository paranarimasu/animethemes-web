There were 20 episodes at 14 minutes each. A Japanese dub was then produced by Haoliner's Japanese branch, Emon, which aired on TV in Winter 2017 under the title Spiritpact. Each TV episode was comprised of two ONA episodes with minor aesthetic touch-ups. Thus, the Japanese (and Crunchyroll-licensed) version has 10 episodes at 24 minutes each.\n<br><br>(Source: MAL, edited)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Mugendai","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"spiritpact"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Spiritpact-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Endless Stories","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"spiritpact"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Spiritpact-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33605/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/98031/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ling-qi","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/12656","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5283"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5284"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"spiritpact"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
