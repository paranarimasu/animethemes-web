Punch is a bear who is literally strong-headed: his head is as hard as a rock, and nothing can knock him down. Boom the weasel is an expert shot, using not a gun, but a slingshot. Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. <br><br>\nGari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it&rsquo;s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen (about 10 cents in US money) or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength. <br><br>\n(Source: Cartoon Research)<br><br><em>*Based on Hustle Punch by Mori Yasuji, serialized in Manga O.</em>","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Hustle Punch no Uta","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"HustlePunch-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"480","source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Hustle Punch no Uta","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"HustlePunch-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"480","source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/19681/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/19681/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/UAaZ5Cx8Bno2MMlspUz74wCh6rmltaXyXAjVnREn.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/mGaO7OWeKU3Fk4Jj8jZUafltRqKa8AIjQVc28AHR.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"hustle_punch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
