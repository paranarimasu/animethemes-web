No one knows why. No one knows how. But the horrifying tale and the legends of the ghostly haunting that followed live on to this day. Perhaps it's not so surprising then, that among Seikyou's many school clubs is one for students interested in \"paranormal investigations.\" What might raise more than a few hairs, however, is that the founder of the club is the ghost herself. Unable to remember how she died and trapped in the grey land between life and death, Yuuko latches onto Teiichi Niiya, a freshman who can inexplicably see her, and together they and the other unsuspecting members of the club begin to unravel the many dark mysteries that surround Seikyou. Will unlocking the secret of Yuuko's gruesome death finally free her? Or will her sudden close association with a mortal have even stranger repercussions on both of their existences? <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":["Dusk Maiden of Amnesia"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"CHOIR JAIL","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"konomi_suzuki","name":"Konomi Suzuki"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"tasogare_otome_x_amnesia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TasogareOtomeAmnesia-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Calendrier","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tasogare_otome_x_amnesia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-10","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TasogareOtomeAmnesia-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Calendrier -Yuuko-","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tasogare_otome_x_amnesia"},"entries":[{"episodes":"11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TasogareOtomeAmnesia-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12445/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/12445/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5499"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5500"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tasogare_otome_x_amnesia"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
