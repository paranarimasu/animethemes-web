His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa's sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Yuuji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa's friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year.<br><br>\nThe school happens to have developed experiments to summon fantasy creatures, and Akihisa decides to rally F class to take on the higher-tiered classes and seize their perks. The F class uses the summoned creatures in an all-out battle for school supremacy.","synonyms":["Baka and Test - Summon the Beasts","The Idiot, the Tests, and the Summoned Creatures","Baka to Test to Shokanju","BakaTest"],"series":[{"slug":"bakatest","name":"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Perfect-area complete!","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"baka_to_test_to_shoukanjuu"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-8","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BakaTest-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"9-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"BakaTest-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Baka Go Home","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"milktub","name":"milktub"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"baka_to_test_to_shoukanjuu"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-6, 10-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BakaTest-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"BakaTest-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Hare Tokidoki Egao","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"hitomi_harada","name":"Hitomi Harada"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"baka_to_test_to_shoukanjuu"},"entries":[{"episodes":"7-9","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BakaTest-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/6347/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/6347/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/baka-to-test-to-shoukanjuu","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/6747","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/409"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/410"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"baka_to_test_to_shoukanjuu"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
