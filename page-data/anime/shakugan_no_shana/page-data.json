He named her Shana.<br><br>\nNot long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji&rsquo;s normal days come to an end. He sees something bizarre on his way home: people are frozen in a strange fire, and a monster that looks like a large doll is attacking them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl informs him of a desolate truth: \" 'You' don't exist anymore.\"<br><br>\nShe calls herself a Flame Haze who hunts \"Guze no Tomogara\"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a \"Torch\", a substitute of Yuji whose &ldquo;existence&rdquo; has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, \"Mystes\", which contains a precious item in it. When he looks at his chest, he sees within himself a faint flame, just as she said.<br><br>\nIt is in this way that his eternal struggle alongside the girl begins. <br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo) ","synonyms":["Shakugan no Shana: Season I"],"series":[{"slug":"shana","name":"Shakugan no Shana"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Hishoku no Sora","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"mami_kawada","name":"Mami Kawada"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-16, 24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShakuganNoShana-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"being","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"kotoko","name":"KOTOKO"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"17-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShakuganNoShana-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Yoake Umare Kuru Shoujo","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"youko_takahashi","name":"Youko Takahashi"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-14","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShakuganNoShana-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Aka no Seijaku","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yoko_ishida","name":"Yoko Ishida"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"15-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ShakuganNoShana-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/355/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/355/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/IlVG4RoFi5C949BQfua2KfzWbTlfFXMHeQjYWSKx.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/hejaGyPz3uknTIss3TYqxTxX1IF3VyPurcO0DEWB.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"shakugan_no_shana"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
