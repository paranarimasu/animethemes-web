Whether he's examining deep inside a mermaid's gills, stitching up a flesh golem's thigh, assisting a harpy in laying her eggs, or palpating every last scale on a dragon, Glenn is just doing his best to help these girls whose appearances and bodies are all so completely different... so why does he always end up in such precarious positions with his patients? It's all good, though, because it's strictly for medical purposes! He may come close to suffocating from the pressure of his lamia assistant Saphentite's tail coiling around him, but still, the clinic is open for business in this medical fantasy that explores the physiologies of monster girls as never before!<br><br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)<br><br>\n<i>The first episode premiered a week early on streaming services</i>","synonyms":["Monster Girl Doctor"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Campanella Hibiku Sora de","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"monster_musume_no_oisha_san"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-6","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"7-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-OP1v2-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Yasashisa no Namae","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aina_suzuki","name":"Aina Suzuki"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"monster_musume_no_oisha_san"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"MonsterMusumeNoOishaSan-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/40708/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/113286/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/monster-musume-no-oishasan","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3775"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3776"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monster_musume_no_oisha_san"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
