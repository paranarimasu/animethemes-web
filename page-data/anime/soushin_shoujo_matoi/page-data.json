Matoi Sumeragi, a second-year junior high school student, works part-time as a shrine maiden at Tenman Shrine in the city of Kamaya. Ever since being separated from her mother in early childhood, Matoi has been entrusted to her grandparents on her father's side, but three months ago, she finally began to live with her father Shingo. In those circumstances, she only wishes for a peaceful, normal life.<br><br>\n\nHer close friend and part-time workmate Yuma Kusanagi is part of the family of the shrine's chief priest, and is a candidate to be the successor shrine maiden. For generations, her family has performed exorcisms of evil spirits. She invites Matoi to one of these exorcism ceremonies, a so-called \"Divine Possession\" that she will attempt.<br><br>\n\nOne day, Matoi and Yuma walk from the school to the shrine as usual, but when they arrive, they are greeted by the shrine's now damaged grounds, and Yuma's parents have both collapsed from their wounds. Matoi's father Shingo, a police detective, launches an investigation, and he comes upon a man who does not seem entirely sane: his only witness. When he holds down the man, Yuma begins the ritual of Divine Possession.<br><br>\n\nSomething strange then happens, not with Yuma, but with Matoi. Matoi Sumeragi, who had only wanted a normal, peaceful life, takes the role of a god, and gains the power to banish evil spirits! To get her precious everyday life back, Matoi must conduct exorcisms! <br><br>\n\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["Matoi the Sacred Slayer"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Chou Musubi Amulet","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"mia_regina","name":"Mia REGINA"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-5, 7-12","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SoushinShoujoMatoi-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"6","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"SoushinShoujoMatoi-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"My Only Place","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"sphere","name":"Sphere"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-10","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"SoushinShoujoMatoi-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/33668/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21873/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/srghvnuuBQOUWIIIGI5627Bn3V96mYkxEhxmPLRx.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/0H6nyebWDH6e87g6E4YhjqtrtA3IB2KmEghxVNXd.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"soushin_shoujo_matoi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
