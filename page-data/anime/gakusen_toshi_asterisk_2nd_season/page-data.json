In the center of the meteor's crater lies Rikka, a system of six academies known as the Asterisk. Ayato Amagiri enters the Asterisk as a transfer student hoping to compete in a special battle event known as the Festa. However, he quickly finds himself on the bad side of one of the strongest fighters aroundâ€”the beautiful but fiery Julis-Alexa von Riessfeld. To stand against her he'll have to rely on his own sword-wielding ability, but when the tables turn, will they be able to team up to take down the competition? <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["The Asterisk War: The Academy City on the Water","Academy Battle City Asterisk"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"The Asterisk War","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"gakusen_toshi_asterisk_2nd_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GakuenToshiAsteriskS2-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"GakuenToshiAsteriskS2-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Ai no Uta -words of love-","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"haruka_chisuga","name":"Haruka Chisuga"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"gakusen_toshi_asterisk_2nd_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GakuenToshiAsteriskS2-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"GakuenToshiAsteriskS2-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Brand-new World","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"gakusen_toshi_asterisk_2nd_season"},"entries":[{"episodes":"12","nsfw":true,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GakuenToshiAsteriskS2-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31737/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21390/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1607"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1608"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gakusen_toshi_asterisk_2nd_season"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
