In the end, he was backstabbed by his dearest shidi and killed by powerful clans that combined to overpower him. He incarnates into the body of a lunatic who was abandoned by his clan and is later, unwillingly, taken away by a famous cultivator among the clansâ€”Lan Wangji, his archenemy. This marks the start of a thrilling yet hilarious journey of attacking monsters, solving mysteries, and raising children. From the mutual flirtation along the way, Wei Wuxian slowly realizes that Lan Wangji, a seemingly haughty and indifferent poker-face, holds more feelings for Wei Wuxian than he is letting on.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Exiled Rebels Scanlations)","synonyms":["Modao Zushi","Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation","The Founder of Diabolism","The Founder of Evil Magic"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Zui Meng Qianchen","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"mo_dao_zu_shi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"MoDaoZuShi-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Wen Qin","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"mo_dao_zu_shi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-8, 14-15","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"MoDaoZuShi-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Bu Xian","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"mo_dao_zu_shi"},"entries":[{"episodes":"9-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"MoDaoZuShi-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37208/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/101972/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3671"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3672"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mo_dao_zu_shi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
