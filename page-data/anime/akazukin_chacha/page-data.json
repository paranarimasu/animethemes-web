Living with her guardian in a cottage on Mochi-mochi mountain is Seravi, who is her teacher and also the fictional world's greatest magician. Chacha is clumsy in casting her spells because, throughout the anime, when she summons something, it often turns out to be something that she didn't mean to cast, for example, spiders (kumo) instead of a cloud (also kumo). At times in the anime when she and her friends are in trouble, however, her spells do work. Living on the same mountain is a boy gifted with enormous strength named Riiya. It is described that Riiya came from a family of werewolves who can instantly change into a wolf whenever they want. Quite far from Mochi-mochi mountain lies Urizuri mountain. Dorothy, also a well known magician in her land, lives in a castle on Urizuri mountain. Living with her is Shiine, her student. Shiine is adept when it comes to casting spells. He is a young wizard and most of his knowledge about magic was taught to him by Dorothy.<br><br>\nThe first 2 seasons were originally created by the anime team. Most of the stories in season 3 are based on the manga.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)","synonyms":["Red Riding Hood Chacha"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Kimi-iro Omoi","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"akazukin_chacha"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-OP1v3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Egao ga Sukidakara","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"akazukin_chacha"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-31","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Chacha ni Omakase","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"akazukin_chacha"},"entries":[{"episodes":"32-56","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Youkoso Magical School e","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"akazukin_chacha"},"entries":[{"episodes":"57-74","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AkazukinChacha-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/103/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/103/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/akazukin-chacha","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/854","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/167"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/168"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"akazukin_chacha"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
