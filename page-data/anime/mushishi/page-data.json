They differ from other forms of life such as the micro-organisms and the fungi. Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as \"Mushi\". Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a \"Mushi-shi\" who travels around to investigate and find out more about the \"Mushi\". In the process, he also lends a helping hand to people who face problems with supernatural occurances which may be related to the \"Mushi\".<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["Mushi-Shi"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"The Sore Feet Song","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Mushishi-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Mushishi-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/457/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/457/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/5KislI12kvuOFNQkLkfZuNbyUp4aSxMrFLW7Dpdo.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/vBOxeLs99iw6JnMfVMHBsUf321uJo0XGiRowO74n.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mushishi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
