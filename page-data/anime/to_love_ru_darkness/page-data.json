When junior princesses Nana and Momo transferred into Earth School where big sister LaLa can (theoretically) keep an eye on them, things SHOULD be smooth sailing. But when Momo decides she'd like to \"supplement\" Rito's relationship with LaLa with a little \"sisterly love,\" you know LaLa's not going to waste any time splitting harems. Unfortunately, it's just about that point that Yami, the Golden Darkness, enters the scene with all the subtleness of a supernova, along with an army of possessed high school students! All of which is certain to make Rito's life suck more than a black hole at the family picnic. Unless, of course, a certain semi-demonic princess can apply a little of her Develukean Whoop Ass to exactly that portion of certain other heavenly bodies! <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":[],"series":[{"slug":"to_love_ru","name":"To LOVE-Ru"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"RAKUEN PROJECT","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ray","name":"Ray"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"to_love_ru_darkness"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ToLoveRuDarkness-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Foul Play ni Kurari","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"kanon_wakeshima","name":"Kanon Wakeshima"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"to_love_ru_darkness"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"ToLoveRuDarkness-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/13663/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/13663/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/to-love-ru-darkness","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5655"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5656"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"to_love_ru_darkness"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
