Despite missing this beneficial aspect, Sora's unwavering drive never allowed his small stature to dictate his ability to play, believing strongly in trying his hardest and persistently practicing to prove his capability.<br>\n<br>\nIn hopes of satisfying his mother's wishes, Sora enters Kuzuryuu High School to become a member of the basketball club and compete wholeheartedly in tournaments. However, Sora is disappointed to find out that the boy's basketball team is nothing but a retreat for punks who have no interest in the sport. Sora also comes to learn that brothers Chiaki and Momoharu Hanazono—whom he becomes acquainted with—have also lost their once spirited motivation to play.<br>\n<br>\nDetermined to revive the basketball team, Sora challenges the boys to a match against him, where his quick feet and swift movements overwhelm the group. Gradually affected by Sora's impressive skills, sheer effort, and tireless devotion to basketball, the boys unexpectedly find their burnt-out passion for the game rekindling once again.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MyAnimeList)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Happy Go Ducky!","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13, 50","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Nevermind","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"flumpool","name":"flumpool"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP3","song":{"title":"Humming Bird","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"blue_encount","name":"BLUE ENCOUNT"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"25-33, 35-36","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-OP3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP4","song":{"title":"Rebirth","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"37-39, 41-49","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-OP4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Tsubasa","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Over","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yuuma_uchida","name":"Yuuma Uchida"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Hikari Sasu Hou e","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"mamoru_miyano","name":"Mamoru Miyano"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"25-36","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED4","song":{"title":"Taiyou Runner","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"},"entries":[{"episodes":"37-38, 40-49","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"AhiruNoSora-ED4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37403/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/101239/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/ahiru-no-sora","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/97"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/98"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ahiru_no_sora"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
