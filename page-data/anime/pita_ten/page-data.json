Much to his despair, he one day finds the overly cheerful Misha at his door, asking to be friends out of nowhere. Even more shocking is that Misha is an apprentice angel, yet she does more bad then good. Along with Kotarou's school friends Takashi and Koboshi and the so called devil Shia (once again being able to do more good then bad), the group of friends spend their days getting into all sorts of adventures and troubles. Based on the manga by Koge-Donbo.","synonyms":["Pita-Ten","Pita-ten","Pitaten"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Wake Up Angel ~Negaimashite ha Mugen Nari~","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"pita_ten"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PitaTen-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Chiisa na Mahou","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"miyuki_sawashiro","name":"Miyuki Sawashiro"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"pita_ten"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"PitaTen-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/162/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/162/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/pita-ten","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4351"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4352"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pita_ten"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
