To counter the Nightfly O'Note's threat, the humans establish the LAG defense agency at the Ryūkyū Islands. The anti-Nightfly O'Note fighting unit Scared Rider valiantly stood against the threat, but was completely wiped out five times.<br><br>\n\nAnd so, the sixth and latest unit, Scared Rider Xechs, was assembled from five young men. However, at nearly the same time that SRX was formed, the Nightfly O'Note invasion stopped suddenly.<br><br>\n\nWithout the enemy they were supposed to fight, the SRX members spend their restless days dealing with ordinary life. The SRX members establish the musical band Odd-l's to deal with their low spirits and restlessness. Meanwhile, a young woman is assigned to LAG as their instructor and commander. A new life begins for the young woman and the SRX.
