In order to give his destitute family a better life, his ultimate goal is to obtain the special VIP nomination, a prestigious scholarship covering all future university tuition fees. Although Nariyuki could feasibly be a shoe-in for the nomination, he is constantly overshadowed by classmates Rizu Ogata and Fumino Furuhashi in mathematics and literature, respectively.\n<br><br>\nTo his delight, Nariyuki receives the nomination, but there’s a catch: he has to tutor his two star classmates, who are each hopelessly mediocre at the other’s subject of expertise! To make matters worse, the subjects they are horrible at are the same subjects they want to pursue for their future. As the time to submit university applications draws nearer, Nariyuki must find an effective tutoring method for the girls before it’s too late.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Official Website)","synonyms":["We Never Learn","BokuBen"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Seishun Seminar","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"haruka_shiraishi","name":"Haruka Shiraishi"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"miyu_tomita","name":"Miyu Tomita"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"bokutachi_wa_benkyou_ga_dekinai"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BokuBen-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"BokuBen-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Never Give It Up!!","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"haruka_shiraishi","name":"Haruka Shiraishi"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"miyu_tomita","name":"Miyu Tomita"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"bokutachi_wa_benkyou_ga_dekinai"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"BokuBen-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"BokuBen-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38186/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/103900/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/671"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/672"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bokutachi_wa_benkyou_ga_dekinai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
