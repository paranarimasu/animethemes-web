Well, two other boys and Haru, who claims that he's an alien. Not that constantly stewing Natsuki or mysterious Akira are any more likely as prospects for good companionship. <br><br>\nBut there's something about fishing that makes it unlike any other pastime, and maybe that quiet sense of companionship and hopeful expectation is just what Yuki needs to start charting the unfamiliar waters of personal connections.  Or maybe it will turn out that Haru's right and they're going to have to save the entire planet. <br><br>\nThere are lots of different kinds of fish stories, from the \"ones that got away\" to the \"best catches ever,\" but whichever way the currents of life take them, for four young men, this trip may turn out to be the biggest whopper ever! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Tsurezure Monochrome","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"fujifabric","name":"Fujifabric"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"tsuritama"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Tsuritama-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Sora mo Toberu Hazu","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tsuritama"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Tsuritama-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/12883/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5797"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/5798"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tsuritama"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
