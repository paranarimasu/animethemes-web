Before you lives the future, alternately bright and scary. Behind you lie memories, both happy and sad. And somehow, in the course of one year, you have to reconcile those two and decide where your life is going to go.<br><br>\nFor Wakana Sakai, who had started studying music, it's time to face the tragedy that made her abandon that path. For Sawa Okita, it's about her dreams of riding professionally. And for Konatsu Miyamoto, it's about bringing her friends together through the magic of a song. Can something as simple as the formation of a choir club really help solve the hurts and pangs that come with growing up? Can music bring people together despite their differences?<br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Dreamer","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"airi","name":"AiRI"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TariTari-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Shiokaze no Harmony","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"1","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TariTari-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Shiokaze no Harmony","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"3-5","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TariTari-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Shiokaze no Harmony","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"7-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TariTari-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/13333/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/13333/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/px3Z9FRg0PAPMuuSePtMQ1GMIsEoJvgZYsnjsunQ.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/FKoCorWjTTg2tu2mixBCck5bnGUZydIlEQkwWPXD.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tari_tari"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
