Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world— turning every single human into stone.\n<br><br>\nSeveral millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.\n<br><br>\nHowever, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown.\n<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Good Morning World!","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"burnout_syndromes","name":"BURNOUT SYNDROMES"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DrStone-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"DrStone-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Sangenshoku","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DrStone-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"LIFE","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DrStone-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"DrStone-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Yume no You na","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"DrStone-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38691/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/105333/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/dagdKyPiQIYJLikhGt9XmOIPlwPiunpCKs8hYrNX.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/CCBQduoytfyhnpsDduKxdr0UkcC9VbO5gWvYF6Sx.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dr_stone"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
