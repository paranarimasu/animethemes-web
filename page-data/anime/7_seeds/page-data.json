The Seven Seeds project was developed out of this meeting. Each country froze a number of young healthy people, which allowed them to survive the meteor. After the computer determined that Earth was once again safe for human life, it released them into the world.\n<br><br>\nThe Japanese government created five groups of survivors: Winter group, Spring group, Summer group A, Summer group B, and Fall group. Each group consisted of seven members and one guide. The guide carried small tubes of poison on their necks to allow them to end their lives if their situation became unbearable. The Japanese government prepared seven \"Fuji\" as refuges for the groups. In each Fuji, the group would find seeds and numerous books instructing them on survival in the wilderness.\n<br><br>\n<i>It premiered on TV on January 14th, 2020.</i>","synonyms":["7SEEDS"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Ark","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"7_seeds"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"7Seeds-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"WISH","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"7_seeds"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"7Seeds-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/38735/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/105807/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/seven-seeds","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/39"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/40"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7_seeds"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
