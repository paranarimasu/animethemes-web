He even figured out who is behind it all: The NHK, an evil secret company. <br><br>\n\"When you think anime, you think otaku. When you think otaku, you think people that dislike other people. Those people become hikikomori (people who shut themselves in)\". So Satou manages to uncover the plot of The NHK (stands for Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai), after three years of shutting himself in (and rapidly approaching the fourth). <br><br>\nIn reality, he is nothing more than a NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training), desperately in need of a cure from that \"disease\". He wants to break out from the curse, but going out and getting a job is frightening enough for him. That is until he gets selected for a \"project\"; it is a plan to help hikikomori like him in facing the reality of this world.<br><br>\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["Welcome to the N.H.K."],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Puzzle","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"round_table","name":"Round Table featuring Nino"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"nhk_ni_youkoso"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"NHKNiYoukoso-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Puzzle -extra hot mix-","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"round_table","name":"Round Table featuring Nino"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"nhk_ni_youkoso"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-23","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"NHKNiYoukoso-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Odoru Akachan Ningen","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"nhk_ni_youkoso"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"NHKNiYoukoso-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Modokashii Sekai no Ue de","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"yui_makino","name":"Yui Makino"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"nhk_ni_youkoso"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-22, 24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"NHKNiYoukoso-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1210/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3957"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3958"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"nhk_ni_youkoso"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
