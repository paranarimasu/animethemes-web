Nekki Basara is a guitarist and a singer of the band Fire Bomber. Living in a less-developed part of the flying colony City 7 which is looking for a habitable planet, he composes and sings songs in the belief that music holds a greater power.<br><br>\nDuring its flight, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon City 7. However, its attacks are not conventional -- instead of trying to destroy them, they steal what is known as \"spiritia\", rendering victims unresponsive and zombie-like. During these battles, Basara always goes out into the middle of the warzone, singing his songs and expecting friend and foe to listen and be moved by his music.<br><br>\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":["M7"],"series":[{"slug":"macross","name":"Macross"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Seventh Moon","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"macross_7"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Macross7-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"My Friends","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"macross_7"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-34","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Macross7-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"...Dakedo Baby!!","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"macross_7"},"entries":[{"episodes":"35-48","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Macross7-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1397/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1397/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/macross-7","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/442","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3325"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3326"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"macross_7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
