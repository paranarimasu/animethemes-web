As the conduit of the Photon Battery energy source to the surface, it is regarded as sacred.<br>\n<br>\nBellri Zenam is in the middle of training for the Capital Guard (established to protect the Capital Tower), when the tower is attacked by the G-Self â€” a highly maneuverable mobile suit with technology that is not from any known country.<br>\n<br>\nBellri, who joins the battle in the maintenance mobile suit Recten, successfully captures the G-Self. However, Bellri feels something for the space pirate girl named Aida Surugan who piloted the G-Self. It is the same feeling he has for the G-Self, even though he supposedly never seen it before. The G-Self, which should only be operable under specific conditions, is somehow started up by Bellri.<br>\nThe objective of Aida and the space pirates who attacked the Capital Tower, and the fate followed by Bellri who was chosen by the G-Self, will lead to truths that will shake the entire Regild Century era.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: ANN)<br>\n<br>\nThe first 3 episodes premiered theatrically from August 23, 2014 to September 5, 2014 with the regular TV broadcast starting on October 3, 2014.","synonyms":[],"series":[{"slug":"gundam","name":"Mobile Suit Gundam"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Blazing","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"garnidelia","name":"GARNiDELiA"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"gundam_g_no_reconguista"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GundamGNoReconguista-OP1","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"G no Senkou","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"gundam_g_no_reconguista"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"GundamGNoReconguista-ED1","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/23259/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/20658/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/gundam-g-no-reconguista","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/10531","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1927"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1928"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gundam_g_no_reconguista"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
