Thanks to the \"Cultural Exchange Between Species Act,\" these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.<br>\n<br>\nWhen a hapless human teenager named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a \"volunteer\" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down. A snake-like lamia named Miia comes to live with him, and it is Kurusu's job to take care of her and make sure she integrates into his everyday life.<br>\n<br>\nUnfortunately for Kurusu, Miia is undeniably sexy, and the law against interspecies breeding is very strict. Even worse, when a ravishing centaur girl and a flirtatious harpy move in, what's a full-blooded teenage human with raging hormones to do?!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":["Everyday Life with Monster Girls","MonMusu"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Saikousoku Fall in Love","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ari_ozawa","name":"Ari Ozawa"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"sora_amamiya","name":"Sora Amamiya"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"monster_musume_no_iru_nichijou"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Monmusu-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":true}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Hey!
