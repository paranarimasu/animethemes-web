Forced into the Galaxy Police, his luck begins to change. A natural to randomly jumping near pirates, he is assigned his own decoy to draw out pirates. His luck brings him into the lives of four women who have a habit of cancelling out his bad luck, turning it into good.

Now the only uncertainty is whether the sexy Amane Kaunaq, a former model turned into a GP detective, sturdy Kiriko Masaki, who has known Seina for years, the mysterious Ryoko Balta, a former pirate named after the legendary one, or the child-like Neju Na Melmas, a powerful 2000 year-old priestess, will win Seina.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)","synonyms":[],"series":[{"slug":"tenchi_muyou","name":"Tenchi Muyou!"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Mayonaka no Taiyou","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tenchi_muyou_gxp"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TenchiMuyouGXP-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":544,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"14-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"TenchiMuyouGXP-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":544,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"26","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"TenchiMuyouGXP-OP1v3","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":544,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Anata ga Saitei...","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"tenchi_muyou_gxp"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TenchiMuyouGXP-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":544,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"14-26","nsfw":true,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"TenchiMuyouGXP-ED1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":544,"source":"DVD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/1133/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/1133/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/358","site":"aniDB"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/tenchi-muyo-gxp","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6378"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/6379"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tenchi_muyou_gxp"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
