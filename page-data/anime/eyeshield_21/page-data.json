Huge hulking bodies throw themselves at each other, while a tiny lithe body runs between them for the goal!  No, it&rsquo;s not a game of football, it&rsquo;s Sena Kobayakawa trying to evade the monstrous Ha-Ha brothers down the halls of Deimon High School!  But wait!  Sena&rsquo;s incredible skills at not getting caught have been spotted by the devilish (possibly actually demonic) captain of the school&rsquo;s embryonic American style football team, and when Sena asks to be the teams manager, he gets  thrust onto the field as a running back instead!  But there are two BIG catches: first, to keep the identity of their new &ldquo;star&rdquo; player an absolute secret, Yoichi makes Sena wear an opaque visor on his helmet and gives him the alias of &ldquo;Eyeshield 21.&rdquo;  And the second catch?  Well, in order to hit his fastest &ldquo;speed of light&rdquo; running mode, Sena usually has to be absolutely terrified. Not that THAT will be a problem with the monstrous players that he&rsquo;ll soon find himself running from!  The insanity hits the streets when the feet meet the cleats in EYESHIELD 21! <br><br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":["Eyeshield21"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Breakthrough","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-35","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Innocence","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"36-64","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP3","song":{"title":"Dang Dang","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"65-103, 145","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-OP3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP4","song":{"title":"BLAZE LINE","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"back_on","name":"BACK-ON"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"104-126","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-OP4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP5","song":{"title":"Hanno no Runningback","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"127-145","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-OP5","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Be Free","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Blaze Away","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-35","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Goal","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"36-64","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED4","song":{"title":"Run to Win","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aya_hirano","name":"Aya Hirano"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"65-100","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED5","song":{"title":"A day dreaming...","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"back_on","name":"BACK-ON"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"101-116","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED5","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED6","song":{"title":"Flower","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"back_on","name":"BACK-ON"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"117-126","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED6","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED7","song":{"title":"Song of Power","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"},"entries":[{"episodes":"127-144","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Eyeshield21-ED7","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":480,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/15/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/15/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/eyeshield-21","site":"Kitsu"},{"link":"https://anidb.net/anime/2441","site":"aniDB"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1389"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1390"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eyeshield_21"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
