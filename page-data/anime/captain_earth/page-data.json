Traveling to Tanegashima, Daichi quickly finds himself involved with the machinations of Globe, a secret agency created to defend mankind from extraterrestrial forces. And while it might seem like a big job for a mere teenager, it turns out that the skills Daichi has honed on video games, combined with a special weapon called the Livlaster, make Daichi ideally suited for operating the Earth Engine Impacter, a giant robot that may be Mankind's best hope against aliens whose goal is to completely drain our world's lifeforce energy. Fortunately, Daichi won't be on his own, as he's quickly joined by a group of equally dedicated young people who all have their own skills and abilities to contribute to the battle.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Believers High","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"flumpool","name":"flumpool"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"captain_earth"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"CaptainEarth-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"TOKYO Dreamer","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"nico_touches_the_walls","name":"NICO Touches the Walls"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"captain_earth"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-25","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"CaptainEarth-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Amethyst","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"ai_kayano","name":"Ai Kayano"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"captain_earth"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"CaptainEarth-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"The Glory Days","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"captain_earth"},"entries":[{"episodes":"14-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"CaptainEarth-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/21677/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/20446/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/771"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/772"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"captain_earth"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
