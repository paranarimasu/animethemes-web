It’d be idyllic, if it weren’t a lie. Randy’s embezzled a load of cash, and Fujiko couldn’t care less about the family. Or... is that the lie? When the corporation Randy stole from sends a bizarre man to kill him, Fujiko heeds Randy’s request to protect Gene, and goes beyond the pale for the boy.<br>\n<br>\nStill... could that be yet another lie? Gene knows where the money is, and refuses to say until he’s avenged his father. What will Fujiko do? Will her lies spin out of control? Or was every man just playing to her tune from the start? All things may not be what they seem in Takeshi Koike’s newest Lupin the IIIrd film, Fujiko’s Lie!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)","synonyms":["Lupin the IIIrd: Fujiko Mine's Lie"],"series":[{"slug":"lupin","name":"Lupin III"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Innocent deceiver","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"lupin_the_iiird_mine_fujiko_no_uso"},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"LupinMineFujikoNoUso-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/39487/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/107313/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3305"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/3306"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"lupin_the_iiird_mine_fujiko_no_uso"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
