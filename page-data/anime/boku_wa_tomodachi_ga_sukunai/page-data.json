It doesn't help that his blond hair tends to make people think he's a delinquent. One day, he runs into his bad-tempered solitary classmate Yozora while she's talking animatedly to her imaginary friend Tomo. Realizing that neither of them have any actual friends, they decide that the best way to alter this situation is to form a club and start recruiting. <br><br>\nThat is how \"Rinjinbu\", The Neighbours' Club, was formed, a club specifically designed for people who don't have very many friends. As other lonely classmates slowly join their little club, they'll try to learn how to build friendships through cooking together, playing games, and other group activities. But will this group of relationship-challenged misfits really be able to get along?  <br><br>\n(Source: MangaUpdates)","synonyms":["Haganai","I Don't Have Many Friends"],"series":[{"slug":"haganai","name":"Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"}],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Zannenkei Rinjinbu (Hoshi Futatsu Han)","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"kana_hanazawa","name":"Kana Hanazawa"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"kanae_itou","name":"Kanae Itou"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"marina_inoue","name":"Marina Inoue"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"misato_fukuen","name":"Misato Fukuen"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"nozomi_yamamoto","name":"Nozomi Yamamoto"},"as":""},{"artist":{"slug":"yuka_iguchi","name":"Yuka Iguchi"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-11","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Haganai-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"Haganai-OP1v2","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Watashi no Kimochi","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"marina_inoue","name":"Marina Inoue"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Haganai-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"1080","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/10719/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/10719/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/VLl3tkwUg9gA61qa8PoSWY7etk4EJf0XxSTF9kfm.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/F9o87ZD3eCXXEssXpxaTYNys2ht2BcJIeEgzuAE9.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"boku_wa_tomodachi_ga_sukunai"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
