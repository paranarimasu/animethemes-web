Hyakkimaru's father, a greedy feudal lord, had made a pact with 12 demons, offering his yet-unborn son's body parts in exchange for great power. Thus, Hyakkimaru - who was born without arms, legs, eyes, ears, a nose or a mouth - was abandoned in a river as a baby. Rescued and raised by Dr. Honma, who equips him with artificial limbs and teaches him sword-fighting techniques, Hyakkimaru discovers that each time he slays a demon, a piece of his body is restored. Now, he roams the war-torn countryside in search of demons.","synonyms":["Dororo to Hyakkimaru"],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Kaen","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"dororo"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-OP1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Dororo2019-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"Dororo","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"akfg","name":"Asian Kung-Fu Generation"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"dororo"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-OP2-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Dororo2019-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Sayonara Gokko","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"dororo"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED1-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Yamiyo","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"dororo"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13-16","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED2-NCBD1080","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"17-20","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":2,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED2v2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]},{"episodes":"21-24","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":3,"videos":[{"filename":"Dororo2019-ED2v3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":1080,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37520/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/101347/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1225"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/1226"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dororo"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
