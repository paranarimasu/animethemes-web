However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia.\n<br><br>\nTennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\n<br><br>\n(Source: VNDB)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP1","song":{"title":"Philosophyz","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-4, 6","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"OP2","song":{"title":"End of the World","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"8-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-OP2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED1","song":{"title":"Sasayaki na Hajimari","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"2-3, 6-7","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED2","song":{"title":"Koibumi","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"nagi_yanagi","name":"Nagi Yanagi"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"4","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED2","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Over","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":true,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED3","song":{"title":"Sunbright","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"5","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED3","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":true,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED4","song":{"title":"Word of Dawn","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aoi_tada","name":"Aoi Tada"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"8-9, 11-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED4","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"None","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED5","song":{"title":"Itsuwaranai Kimi e","performances":null},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"10","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED5","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Over","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":true,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED6","song":{"title":"Yami no Kanata e","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"nagi_yanagi","name":"Nagi Yanagi"},"as":""}]},"anime":{"slug":"rewrite"},"entries":[{"episodes":"13","nsfw":false,"spoiler":true,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"Rewrite-ED6","lyrics":false,"nc":false,"overlap":"Transition","resolution":720,"source":"","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/31716/","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/21382/","site":"AniList"},{"link":"https://kitsu.io/anime/rewrite","site":"Kitsu"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4575"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://staging.animethemes.moe/image/4576"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"rewrite"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
