A well liked girl in school named Hiromi has lived in his house for a year along with his family. Her father was a close friend of the family, and when he died they immediately took her in. She is popular and well liked, always smiles, is talented in sports- but Shinichiro knows there must be tears inside her. Having an artistic tendency, he makes watercolours of her and thinks about wishing to ease her tears. Yet he cannot bring up the nerve to talk to her even in his own home. She, too, is quiet and withdrawn in their house, quite unlike at school. Shinichiro is also distracted by teasing from his friend Nobuse for watching Hiromi from afar, a curse of bad luck from a strange girl named Noe, and being forced to perform Muhiga dancing. By helping Noe he hopes to ease his own problems, yet he seems to have difficulty helping himself.<br><br>\n(Source: ANN)","synonyms":[],"series":[],"themes":[{"group":"","slug":"OP","song":{"title":"Reflectia","performances":null},"entries":[{"episodes":"","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TrueTears-OP1-Lyrics","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"TrueTears-OP1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]},{"group":"","slug":"ED","song":{"title":"Sekai no Namida","performances":[{"artist":{"slug":"aira_yuuki","name":"Aira Yuuki"},"as":""}]},"entries":[{"episodes":"1-12","nsfw":false,"spoiler":false,"version":1,"videos":[{"filename":"TrueTears-ED1-Lyrics","lyrics":true,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false},{"filename":"TrueTears-ED1","lyrics":false,"nc":true,"overlap":"None","resolution":"720","source":"BD","subbed":false,"uncen":false}]}]}],"resources":[{"link":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/2129/True_Tears","site":"MyAnimeList"},{"link":"https://anilist.co/anime/2129/","site":"AniList"}],"images":[{"facet":"Large Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/02QQwVAgtDs0XQYIrqRwA4EyNBTnA8Emlrif6XMn.png"},{"facet":"Small Cover","link":"https://animethemes-stag-images.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/uAO3uQPveQhx7RhtdL8qfv5Lwj78RXeB6JPOArgB.png"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"true_tears"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2614945097","2614945097"]}
